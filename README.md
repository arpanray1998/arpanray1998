=====Introduction=====

From highly critical infrastructure such as DAM's to agricultural reservoirs, artificial impoundments are subject to external environmental influences such as varying precipitation levels and floods. A reservoir system needs to adapt to the changing water levels to ensure that a certain water level is maintained to sustain its functionality. To do that, the inflow and outflow rates of water into and out of the system needs to be controlled and coordinated. One or more parts of such a system also has the potential to be used as a warning and alert system for major floods, that might damage such infrastructure. This project demonstrates a scaled down and simplified version of such a system. It uses the Arduino Uno as the core microcontroller coupled with other input and output devices that work inside a program loop tasked to continuously monitor water level in a reservoir and take suitable action if needed. This system is tasked with two main functions, 1) check water level if it crosses a predefined safe limit send off an alarm and start pumping. 2) If pumping capacity is exceeded switch to manual control and request human intervention to open the sluice gates and allow active drain until water level returns to safe level. The main components in this system is a Microcontroller, a Water pump, a servo emulating the sluice gate a buzzer for the alarm, an LCD display, an Ultrasonic sensor and a joystick controller for manual control. The Ultrasonic sensor module continuously sends and receives sound waves that reflect off the water surface and is received again providing the water level this data is then fed to the Microcontroller that takes the input and evaluates the level based on predefined safety levels and commands the output devices to operate in a manner such that the safety level of water can be maintained (Arpan Ray).

A Dam is an artificial obstruction to the flow of a river created intentionally to harness the kinetic energy stored in the flowing river stream as can be seen in figure 2. As a result, a reservoir is formed. This reservoir needs to maintain a certain level of water the volume of which the dam is able to withstand. If the volume increases, the Dam's structural integrity would be put to risk and after a threshold volume the dam wall will no longer be able to hold back the impoundment and collapse. This can cause damage to human lives and critical infrastructure such as Hydel power stations that can cause blackout in the region for months. To prevent such a scenario, a system for flood warning and control is essential that can detect the increase in the water level in the reservoir by monitoring it continuously and set off alarms depending on various levels of risk. Furthermore the dam gate may need to be opened if the pumping capacity is exceeded to save the structure from collapsing. This is done through manual human intervention as the system sets of a continuous alarm warning the Dam control crew members to open the gate to the required extent in order to drain the excess water to bring it down within the pumping capacity again after which it may again be closed.

The system prototype demonstrated in this project is a highly simplified version of the real system since a real reservoir would have many more parts and complicated connections but the flow of control shown in this demonstration will remain the same. This system may also be expanded to perform many more useful functions and tailored to specific needs such as remote monitoring, telemetry through MQTT, implementation to monitor natural impoundments such as Glacial Lakes, Rivers etc where cheap, simple, robust and easy to maintain systems are necessary which would require minimal maintenance in remote Mountain areas (Arpan Ray).

=====Materials & Methods=====

===Method===

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a situation which shows how a dam and an impoundment will respond in the condition of the flood caused by heavy rainfall. Two situations are taken into account while assessing the contrasting flood conditions. In the first condition, the water level of the dam will rise due to intense rainfall. A temporary pump that has been installed will be sufficient to drain and the excess water will be drained out. The second situation is that due to continuous rainfall, the water level is still rising even though the pump is active, the overall reservoir water level is still rising because the pumping capacity is exceeded. The ultrasonic sensor is measuring the water level rise and gives an alert signal that the critical water limit has been crossed and the dam structural integrity is in danger. With the help of the manual control by joystick, the servo motor will open the gate. Now in this situation, the water outflow will have two directions; from the water pump as well as from the servo. This output flow rate is much higher than the input rainfall which will cause the water level comes down to its normal level and then the green led will go up (Ayush Hemdani). 

To achieve this an artificial symbolic Reservoir has been setup as can be seen in Figures 3 & 4 and has been graduated with a marker for ease of interpretation.

===Materials Used===

1. Arduino Uno :

{{:amc2020-2:img_2718.jpg?200|}}

Figure 6 showing Arduino Uno Microcontroller board (Photo : Shardul Mishra)

It is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P (datasheet). It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which six can be used as PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) outputs), six analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator (CSTCE16M0V53-R0), a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. Arduino Uno contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with an AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. Arduino board itself is just a printed circuit board with the integrated circuit inside. Pin headers are also attached, which allows the integrated circuit to connect with the simulated software on the computer via USB cable. It helps the user perform logical computation by reading the inputs from a sensor or pushing a push-button and results in an output such as an alarm signal or start of a servo motor. For example, if the soil is dry, add some water; if the sun is shiny, keep the air conditioner (like a logic gate OR, AND, NAND, NOT, NOR, EXOR, e.t.c) (Aayush Hemdani).

2. ultrasonic sensor :

{{:amc2020-2:img_2723.jpg?200|}}

Figure 7 showing an Ultrasonic sensor module (Shardul Mishra)

It transmits ultrasonic waves into the air and detects reflected waves from an object. There are many ultrasonic sensors applications, such as intrusion alarm systems, automatic door openers and backup sensors for automobiles. This ultrasonic sensor module HC - SR04 has a non-contact measurement function that operates between 2cm to 400cm. The module includes ultrasonic transmitters, receiver and control circuit. It consists of a four-pin wire connection which includes a 5Volt power supply, trigger pulse, echo pulse and ground. It works on a principle in which an IO trigger is used for at least 10us high-level signal. In response, the module automatically sends eight 40 kHz and detect whether there is a pulse signal back. If the signal is back, through high level, time of high output IO duration is the time from sending ultrasonic to returning. Test distance = (high level time√óvelocity of sound (340M/S) / 2. More details can be found in the source given below. (Aayush Hemdani)

Figure 8 showing a Breadboard (Shardul Mishra)


It is a solderless device that is used to prototype electronic circuits. The standard large size and slightly smaller size are the most common ones which are used. Also, some of the breadboards come with binding posts for power sources as well. The working process of each one of them is almost the same, regardless of which ones are used for the circuit test run. Bigger breadboards have lines running all the way down the longer side which are known as the power lines, where the microcontroller or power supply can be plugged into them to supply power to the components. On the inside running perpendicular to these power lines are the lines or holes where the components are placed to build a circuit. These holes in the lines are connected by strips of metal underneath the board (Aayush Hemdani).

6. Single Channel Relay :

{{:amc2020-2:img_2721.jpg?200|}}

Figure 11 showing a Single channel Relay switch (Shardul Mishra)


A Single channel Relay is an electromechanical Relay module device that uses an electric current to open or close the contacts of a switch. It consists of input pins (Relay trigger, Ground, Vcc) and output sources (Normally open (NO), Normally Closed (NC) and common). The small transistor on the relay magnetizes the magnetic coil inside when the input current is applied. This enables the contacts (NO, NC) connection and as result LED indicates the working status of the relay. The operating voltage is between (5-12) Volts and for each channel, the input signal is 3-5 Volts. The maximum AC load current is 10 Amps at 250/125 DC and the Maximum DC load current is 10 Amps at 30/28 DC (Aayush Hemdani).

Figure 13 showing a I2C interface (Shardul Mishra)


It is an interface that provides communication between a master and multiple slave devices or even multiple master devices. Here in this project, this interface is used to communicate between the LCD display with two lines SCL(Serial Clock) and SDA(Serial Data). The SCL line is the clock signal that synchronises the data transfer between the devices on the I2C bus and the SDA line carries the data (Aayush Hemdani).

Figure 14 showing an AC/DC adapter (Shardul Mishra)



An AC/DC adapter is made up of a central unit that draws power from an AC outlet, it then converts the power to DC that is used to charge the device. Each AC adapter has a specific power rating, measured in volts or watts that it can handle and the output of a device (Aayush Hemdani).

10. LED :

{{:amc2020-2:img_2731.jpg?200|}}

Figure 15 showing LED lights (Shardul Mishra)


It is a PN  junction diode that emits light when it is activated. The PN junction is surrounded by a transparent hard plastic epoxy reason hemispherical shaped shell to protect the diode from external shock. When a sufficient voltage is applied then the electrons are capable of recombining with the electron holes within the device which releases the energy in the form of photons. This effect is called electroluminescence, and the colour of the light is determined by the energy bandgap of the semiconductor. LEDs are made from direct gap semicondu++-ctor compounded such as Gallium Arsenide, Gallium Phosphide, Gallium Arsenide Phosphide, Silicon Carbide and Gallium Indium nitride. Also, they may be mixed together at different ratios to produce more distinct wavelengths of colours (Aayush Hemdani).

{{:amc2020-2:img_2719.jpg?200|}}

Figure 16 showing Piezoelectric buzzer (Shardul Mishra)


A buzzer is a very small and compact 2-pin component that creates the beep sound due to the internal oscillating circuit present inside it. pin-1 is a long terminal lead(+) that can be powered by 6 Volt DC and pin-2 is a short terminal lead(-) that is connected to the Ground. The operating Voltage is 4-8 Volt DC and the rated current is less than 30 mA. The Resonant Frequency approximately 2300 Hz. Also, the buzzer is normally connected with a switching circuit to turn ON or OFF the buzzer at the required time and require interval (Aayush Hemdani).

Figure 17 showing Servo motor (Shardul Mishra)


Servo motor has integrated gears and a shaft that can be precisely controlled by varying the angles of the positioned shaft between 0 and 180 degrees which eventually results in a set of various speeds. Servo motors have three wires which are red, black and brown power, ground, and signal. The power wire is typically red and should be connected to the 5 Volts pin on the Arduino board. The ground wire is typically black or brown and should be connected to a ground pin on the Arduino board (Aayush Hemdani).

=====Discussion & Conclusion=====

The system worked as expected although certain things needed to be adjusted. The main challenge faced was that the system was getting overloaded when we tried to demonstrate situation 2 i.e in situation 2, as the water level was slowly rising, we would expect that first the alarm for situation 1 would go off and the water pump would start after which the situation 2 alarm would go off. This unfortunately did not happen. The system responded directly to situation 2 although the code shows that the control sequence places sit. 1 before sit. 2. We think that this maybe due to an overloaded system where too many input and output operations are taking place simultaneously. Another problem was that the connector pins were coming out of the male - female connectors because of loose connections and this problem was resolved by taping the two ends of the wires. 

Overall by implementing this project we got to learn a great deal about such control systems and its related electronics. This has given us the impetus to think bigger and explore new ideas. This is a simple demonstration of the flow of control to prevent overloading and collapse of a reservoir but can be expanded by the inclusion of real-time data transfer and remote monitoring can be done using MQTT and Node-red which would allow us to transfer store and analyse data remotely away from harsh environments.
